Source code for EMNLP2020 paper: Dynamic Relational Learning For Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion

Few-shot Knowledge Graph (KG) completion is a focus of current research, where each task aims at querying unseen facts of a relation given few-shot reference entity pairs. 
This work proposes an adaptive attentional network for few-shot KG completion by learning adaptive entity and reference representations. Evaluation in link prediction on two public datasets shows that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results with different few-shot sizes.
